This raw data contains more data than is analyzed in the paper.
We have only analyzed the LOAD phase of YCSB workload A. This workload phase is executed first in every experiment. 
Thereafter the RUN phase of workload A and other workloads are executed. We have not analyzed these RUN phase  
because we are only interested in write-heavy workloads with no reads.
